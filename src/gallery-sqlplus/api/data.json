The property names will be complete strings of\n                the column names returned by SQL*Plus.  For example the query, \"SELECT count(*) FROM users;\" will\n                return an array with one object.  That object will have one property called 'COUNT(*)'.  In cases of complex names\n                I recommend renaming the columns like this, \"SELECT count(*) AS count FROM users;\".  For Oracle number column types,\n                the values returned should be numbers or null.  For Oracle text column types, the values returned should be strings\n                or null.  Oracle date and time column types get converted to text; I recommend using the PL/SQL TO_CHAR function to\n                manually specify the date and time formats that are returned.  Oracle clob values appear to be selectable just like\n                other text values except they may get truncated to 2000000000 characters.  All returned string values will have\n                leading and trailing whitespace trimmed.  Other column types have not been tested.  Complex column types could\n                probably be made to work, but have not been implemented.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                A DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statemet query will return the number rows affected by the query.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Other types of queries have not been tested and aren't supported by the execute method.
