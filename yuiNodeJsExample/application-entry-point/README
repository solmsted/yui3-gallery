Example of combining npm and yui modules.

This module depends on yui and all the other custom yui modules used by the
application.

If each custom module is in its own git repo, and if the git urls are specified
in the package.json, the deploying the entire application should be as simple
as cloning application-entry-point and running `npm install` in its directory.

application-entry-point.js can be executable.
